# GenAI_Autotestdesign

This is a Gen AI-based solution that automates the extraction of testing requirements from JIRA, generates test cases based on those requirements, and loads the generated test cases into TestRail, a test automation tool. The solution aims to streamline the software testing process by leveraging AI to create test cases from detailed requirements, reducing manual effort and improving testing efficiency.

Use Case Description

•	Extract Testing Requirement from JIRA: The system will connect to the JIRA platform to extract relevant testing requirements. These requirements could be in the form of user stories, tasks, or bug tickets that specify testing needs for specific features or functionalities.

•	Generate Test Cases Using AI: Once the testing requirements are extracted, an AI model will be used to generate test cases based on the extracted data. These test cases will be detailed, including positive and negative test scenarios.

•	Load Test Cases into TestRail: After test cases are generated, they will be automatically loaded into the TestRail test management tool. TestRail will serve as the central repository for tracking test cases, test execution, and test results.
